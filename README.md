# liri-node-app

### Command line virtual assistant built with Node using multiple APIs and packages including Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB. The app can also read a command from an included text file “Random.txt” and log its usage history.

In order to run this yourself, you would need to provide your own credentials in a .env file for Twitter and Spotify.

If you prefer to simply see an overview of the app, please see the walkthrough example screenshots below:
